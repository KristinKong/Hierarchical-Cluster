# Hierarchical-Cluster
##Use python to implement hierarchical cluster by centroid-linkage way</br>
  </br>
## 1. Configuration Environment
      IDE: Pycharm 2018 2.3 x64</br>
      Interpreter: Anaconda 3 (syntax is python 3.6)</br>

## 2. How to run (Note: I have already done the initial configuration which could be run directly)
      (1) Modify the configuration file of config.cfg in the folder.</br>
      (2) Each parameter is separated by a comma (,) and a comma is added at the end.</br>
      (3) The effective number of lines in the configuration file is from the first line to the sixth line.</br>
      <b>Attention:</b>Only the first 6 lines of Iris are valid in the current file.</br>
